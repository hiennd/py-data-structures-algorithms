** Dutch National Flag Problem **
**Time Complexity**
- Time Complexity: O(n)
as we traverse the input_list only once, some steps back in case of 2s value will not increase the total number of steps.
Because the loop terminate when mid_index <= high_index
**Spcace Complexity**
- Space: O(1)
as no extra space required.
